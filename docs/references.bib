  abstract = {Current practices in health risk assessment from vapor intrusion (VI) using mathematical models are based on assumptions that the subsurface sorption equilibrium is attained. The time required for sorption to reach near-steady-state conditions at sites may take months or years to achieve. This study investigated the vapor phase attenuation of trichloroethylene (TCE) in five soils varying widely in clay and organic matter content using repacked columns. The primary indicators of TCE sorption were vapor retardation rate (Rt), the time required for the TCE vapor to pass through the soil column, and specific volume of retention (VR), and total volume of TCE retained in soil. Results show TCE vapor retardation is mainly due to the rapid partitioning of the compound to SOM. However, the specific volume of retention of clayey soils with secondary mineral particles was higher. Linear regression analyses of the SOM and clay fraction with VR show that a unit increase in clay fraction results in higher sorption of TCE (VR) than the SOM. However, partitioning of TCE vapor was not consistent with the samples' surface areas but was mainly a function of the type of secondary minerals present in soils.},

  volume = {34},

  abstract = {Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are frequent indoor air pollutants. Indoor materials can act as buffers for VOCs, reducing peak concentrations but prolonging the presence of compounds in the air. The purpose of this paper is to present quantitative experimental results on diffusion and sorption of VOCs in indoor materials and to discuss the impact of these processes on indoor air quality. A two-flow system was chosen for the present study because this method allows mass flow across materials to be directly observed. For some materials, effective diffusion coefficients were only 1 order of magnitude below what is found in air. Two types of concrete showed a very high sorption capacity for ethyl acetate. Steady-state calculations were performed within a model room. By considering various wall materials, the influences of diffusion and of sorption on the air quality of the room are discussed. Regarding the case of gypsum board walls, it may be concluded that diffusion through the material can contribute to reducing the room air concentration, especially at low ventilation rates. The results indicate that sorption and diffusion processes can affect the ventilation requirements in such rooms.},
