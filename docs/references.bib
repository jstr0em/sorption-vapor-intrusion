  abstract = {Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are frequent indoor air pollutants. Indoor materials can act as buffers for VOCs, reducing peak concentrations but prolonging the presence of compounds in the air. The purpose of this paper is to present quantitative experimental results on diffusion and sorption of VOCs in indoor materials and to discuss the impact of these processes on indoor air quality. A two-flow system was chosen for the present study because this method allows mass flow across materials to be directly observed. For some materials, effective diffusion coefficients were only 1 order of magnitude below what is found in air. Two types of concrete showed a very high sorption capacity for ethyl acetate. Steady-state calculations were performed within a model room. By considering various wall materials, the influences of diffusion and of sorption on the air quality of the room are discussed. Regarding the case of gypsum board walls, it may be concluded that diffusion through the material can contribute to reducing the room air concentration, especially at low ventilation rates. The results indicate that sorption and diffusion processes can affect the ventilation requirements in such rooms.},

  volume = {306},
  issn = {0304-3894},
  abstract = {Current practices in health risk assessment from vapor intrusion (VI) using mathematical models are based on assumptions that the subsurface sorption equilibrium is attained. The time required for sorption to reach near-steady-state conditions at sites may take months or years to achieve. This study investigated the vapor phase attenuation of trichloroethylene (TCE) in five soils varying widely in clay and organic matter content using repacked columns. The primary indicators of TCE sorption were vapor retardation rate (Rt), the time required for the TCE vapor to pass through the soil column, and specific volume of retention (VR), and total volume of TCE retained in soil. Results show TCE vapor retardation is mainly due to the rapid partitioning of the compound to SOM. However, the specific volume of retention of clayey soils with secondary mineral particles was higher. Linear regression analyses of the SOM and clay fraction with VR show that a unit increase in clay fraction results in higher sorption of TCE (VR) than the SOM. However, partitioning of TCE vapor was not consistent with the samples' surface areas but was mainly a function of the type of secondary minerals present in soils.},

  abstract = {Volatile organic compound (VOC) adsorption by indoor materials will reduce peak concentrations, and subsequent desorption will prolong the presence of a compound indoors. Diffusion within materials plays an important role in this context. The purpose of this paper is to present two experimental set-ups to study VOC diffusion, and to show corresponding experimental results. The Field and Laboratory Emission Cell (FLEC) is in both cases an integral part of the setup. The mass flow of VOC mixtures across gypsum board is studied. Diffusion of less polar VOCs in gypsum board can be fast (diffusion coefficients of 0.001\textendash{}0.003 m2/h). Diffusion coefficients of chlorinated compounds are correlated with boiling points and molecular areas. Different compounds show similar diffusion properties.},

  volume = {161},
  copyright = {All rights reserved},
  issn = {0360-1323},
  abstract = {Temporal variability in indoor air contaminant concentrations at vapor intrusion (VI) sites has been a concern for some time. We consider the source of the reported variability at VI sites located near Hill Air Force Base (AFB) in Utah, an EPA experimental house in Indiana, and Naval Air Station North Island in California. We focus in particular on how the indoor/outdoor pressure differences and air exchange rates affected indoor air contaminant concentrations at these sites. We investigate how these dynamics differ for a site that is characterized by a preferential pathway (like Hill AFB) and VI sites that are not influenced by such pathways, using three-dimensional fluid dynamics models and statistical analysis of the aforementioned sites. A preferential pathway can dramatically increase a VI site's sensitivity to build pressurization, provided there exist a medium allowing effective communication between a contaminant-delivering preferential pathway and the indoor air space, e.g. a permeable subslab space that may be provided by a gravel layer. Preferential pathways may also erroneously indicate the presence of indoor contaminant sources. At sites characterized by significant advective transport from the subslab to the indoor air space, much of the short-term variability in indoor air contaminant concentration can be explained by an impact of fluctuations in indoor/outdoor pressure differences. Meanwhile, air exchange rate variation drives most of the short-term variability at sites characterized by minor variations in advective transport.},

  volume = {437},
  issn = {0048-9697},
  abstract = {The U.S. government and various agencies have published guidelines for field investigation of vapor intrusion, most of which suggest soil gas sampling as an integral part of the investigation. Contaminant soil gas data are often relatively more stable than indoor air vapor concentration measurements, but meteorological conditions might influence soil gas values. Although a few field and numerical studies have considered some temporal effects on soil gas vapor transport, a full explanation of the contaminant vapor concentration response to rainfall events is not available. This manuscript seeks to demonstrate the effects on soil vapor transport during and after different rainfall events, by applying a coupled numerical model of fluid flow and vapor transport. Both a single rainfall event and seasonal rainfall events were modeled. For the single rainfall event models, the vapor response process could be divided into three steps: namely, infiltration, water redistribution, and establishment of a water lens atop the groundwater source. In the infiltration step, rainfall intensity was found to determine the speed of the wetting front and wash-out effect on the vapor. The passage of the wetting front led to an increase of the vapor concentration in both the infiltration and water redistribution steps and this effect is noted at soil probes located 1m below the ground surface. When the mixing of groundwater with infiltrated water was not allowed, a clean water lens accumulated above the groundwater source and led to a capping effect which can reduce diffusion rates of contaminant from the source. Seasonal rainfall with short time intervals involved superposition of the individual rainfall events. This modeling results indicated that for relatively deeper soil that the infiltration wetting front could not flood, the effects were damped out in less than a month after rain; while in the long term (years), possible formation of a water lens played a larger role in determining the vapor intrusion risk. In addition, soil organic carbon retarded the transport process, and damped the contaminant concentration fluctuations.},

  abstract = {In this study, we investigate the soil gas concentration attenuation with diffusive transport in lateral and vertical transport in cases with surface pavements with a pilot-scale tank. Three scenarios were investigated, one with a completely open soil surface and the other two involving partially paved soil surface. The results, on the one hand, indicate that the soil gas concentration generally decreases linearly and exponentially in the vertical and horizontal transport directions, respectively, generally in accordance with available modeling studies. On the other hand, our experiment shows that low-permeability ground covers can increase shallow soil gas concentrations beneath the pavement by at most 3-4 times, inducing higher subslab concentration than that below open ground surface, even if the latter is obtained at a closer location to vapor source. For cases with uniform soil properties, our study suggests exterior soil gas sample should be taken at a depth below the building foundation by half of the building footprint size, if the vapor source is laterally extensive relative to the building footprint, or by 1\,m and 2-3\,m for slab-on-grade and basement scenarios, respectively, if the vapor source is located laterally away from the building.},

  abstract = {Vapor intrusion (VI) investigations often require sampling of indoor air for evaluating occupant risks, but can be confounded by temporal variability and the presence of indoor sources. Controlled pressure methods (CPM) have been proposed as an alternative, but temporal variability of CPM results and whether they are indicative of impacts under natural conditions have not been rigorously investigated. This study is the first involving a long-term CPM test at a house having a multiyear high temporal resolution indoor air data set under natural conditions. Key observations include (a) CPM results exhibited low temporal variability, (b) false-negative results were not obtained, (c) the indoor air concentrations were similar to the maximum concentrations under natural conditions, and (d) results exceeded long-term average concentrations and emission rates under natural conditions by 1\textendash{}2 orders of magnitude. Thus, the CPM results were a reliable indicator of VI occurrence and worst-case exposure regardless of day or time of year of the CPM test.},

The experimental design included multiple cycles of subslab depressurization (SSD) system operation and shut-off during a seven-month period, followed by a year-long period of continuous operation. Results showed that the system provided rapid pressure field extension and radon control as much as 100 days of operation before optimum volatile organic compound (VOC) mitigation was achieved. Greater variability in VOC concentrations than in radon concentrations was observed during the initial mitigation system cycling. Subslab VOC concentrations at numerous locations increased during this initial period of SSD operation, and indoor air VOC concentrations were more variable than radon. However, indoor air concentrations were considerably less variable (and lower) during the first year of continuous mitigation system operation. \textcopyright{}2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},
