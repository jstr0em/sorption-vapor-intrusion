\section*{Highlights}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Different materials can have dramatically different sorptive capacities, with some, like cinderblock, having the capacity to hold 41,000 times more TCE than a comparable volume of contaminated air.
  \item Contaminant transport from the sorbed state can be slow, which can influence timescales in indoor contaminant concentration response.
  \item After a mitigation system has been installed, desorption of TCE from indoor materials can increase the time for a certain reduction in indoor contaminant concentration to occur from a matter of hours to weeks.
\end{itemize}
