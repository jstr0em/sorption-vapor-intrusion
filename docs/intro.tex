What is the message of the paper?

Sorbed contaminants can significantly delay changes in concentration in the indoor air and the soil-gas depending on the particular soil and/or indoor materials found.
This has consequences if one is for instance interested in mitigating or remediating a VI site as sorption may significantly impede this effort.
It also has consequences for rooting out indoor contaminant sources as:
1. Even after ventilation and/or removing potential indoor sources, there may still be contaminant vapors being released from various materials.
2. It may decrease the effectiveness of applying the CPM.

What is the new result/contribution that you want to describe?

This study presents some new sorption information for TCE and runs never-done-before simulations that investigate the potential role of sorption in VI and VI investigations.

What do you want to convince people of?

1. Take indoor materials into account and perhaps removing or covering up exposed materials that have a high sorption capacity.
2. Take it into consideration that contaminants vapors may emanate from soils for a long time, since they potentially have such a large sorption capacity - almost acting a source in of themselves. E.g. that remediation or mitigation effort may be impeded by this.
3. Perhaps desorbing soil/indoor material samples to determine how significant sorption might be warranted.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

% Attention grabbing intro
Many vapor intrusion (VI) contaminants has the capacity to sorb onto soil and various common indoor materials, but the role and more importantly - the consequences of these sorption processes in VI are poorly understood.
The migration of contaminant vapors from its source into the affected building and potential indoor sources are usually the prime concern in VI investigations.
Rarely is the sorbed contaminant vapors in the soil or indoor considered in an investigation, but these may potentially act as a capacitor, storing and releasing contaminant vapors in response to a change in contaminant concentration.
Consequently, contaminant vapors may be much more persistent at a site that has undergone remediation, potentially reducing the effectiveness of mitigation systems, or impeding site investigations.\par

% Some elaboration on these consequences? E.g. cover:
% - EPA site investigation recommendations
% - CPM and potential issues
% - Remediation (are there any examples of vapor being more persistent?)
% Separate paragraph for each?
Measuring contaminant sorption onto materials or soils is not a regular part of VI investigations and thus very little is known of the potential impact of this.
In this paper we will therefore begin to explore this topic through a combined effort of gathering experimental sorption data and incorporating it into three-dimensional finite element models of VI scenarios.
These type of models have been used extensively before and are useful to illuminate some of these issues.
The potential impact of sorption may perhaps be most significant in the application of the controlled pressure method and various mitigation schemes.\par

The controlled pressure method (CPM) is the sequential forced over- and depressurization of a building which in theory max- and minimizes the contaminant entry to the building.
Helping the investigator to ascertain the worst-case VI scenario and help identify potential indoor contaminant sources.
However, if the building has a large capacity to sorb contaminant vapors onto various materials, these may be ad-/absorbed and desorbed in response to the changing condition, potentially preventing coresponding changes in indoor air contaminant concentrations.
The same is true for various mitigation schemes, while they may successfully prevent contaminant vapors from entering the house, these may still be released from the interior over an unknown period of time.\par

% Background on TCE and sorption capacity on materials (Shuai's part). Cover:
% - Which contaminants/material pairs have been investigated? What has been found?
% - Why do we pick TCE and our materials?

1. building material adsorption were stuided before, proved that adsortpion is a thing

2. building material were stuided most with other VOCs with relatively high concentration, which is rarely in the reality 

3.TCE sorption of buidlgin materials at low concentration are less studied










% Why use modeling for this? Cover:
% - Briefly why we wish to model
% - Sorption in other models and their applications (or lack thereof I should say)



% Final paragraph - outlining what we will do:
