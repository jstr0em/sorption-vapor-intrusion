# How does sorption affect VI transport and human exposure?
- Only transiently


# Where might sorption play a role?
- Soil
- Indoor materials
- Concrete slab (or other slab material)


# Why use models to study sorption?

# Who has studied sorption before?
## Experimental studies?

## Modeling studies?
None



# What is the sorptive capacity of various materials?


# When does sorption become a significant factor in...

## Soil transport:
When K_ads overtakes the other terms in R


## Indoor transport/dynamics:
Not known yet

# When should I be worried about sorption/when is it relevant?
- Any non-steady state scenario
- Demonstrate this in... (case studies)
## Mitigation
## Pressure induced fluctuating contaminant entry
