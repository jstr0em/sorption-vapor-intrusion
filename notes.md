# Thoughts on analysis


## Temperature

Outdoor temperature is the best predictor or VI at the Indianapolis site.
Why this is is somewhat of a mystery.

Here are some thoughts on what temperature may do:
* Affect the outdoor humidity, and subsequently indoor humidity, which may affect diffusion somehow.
* Drive the pressure indoor/outdoor pressure differences.
* Increase soil temperatures, promoting "venting".



### Temperature induced soil venting
This at first seemed like a good idea, the increase in surface temperatures may affect soil temps deep _enough_ to increase the diffusion coefficients, providing a greater concentration gradient for the contaminant vapor underneath the structure to escape.
After looking at the soil temperature, this seems unlikely as during the colder months, there is almost no temperature gradient in the soil, yet still siginificant variability.

## The two building sides

The unheated (420) side of the house has lower indoor air concentrations, and more variability.
The median and quartile concentrations are relatively comparable however.
I wonder if this difference in concentration may be attributed to the stack effect, or perhaps air exchange rate.
*These two factors should be considered.*
