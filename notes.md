# Thoughts on analysis


## Temperature

Outdoor temperature is the best predictor or VI at the Indianapolis site.
Why this is is somewhat of a mystery.

Here are some thoughts on what temperature may do:
* Affect the outdoor humidity, and subsequently indoor humidity, which may affect diffusion somehow.
* Drive the pressure indoor/outdoor pressure differences.
* Increase soil temperatures, promoting "venting".



### Temperature induced soil venting
This at first seemed like a good idea, the increase in surface temperatures may affect soil temps deep _enough_ to increase the diffusion coefficients, providing a greater concentration gradient for the contaminant vapor underneath the structure to escape.
After looking at the soil temperature, this seems unlikely as during the colder months, there is almost no temperature gradient in the soil, yet still siginificant variability.

## The two building sides

The unheated (420) side of the house has lower indoor air concentrations, and more variability.
The median and quartile concentrations are relatively comparable however.
I wonder if this difference in concentration may be attributed to the stack effect, or perhaps air exchange rate.
*These two factors should be considered.*

### Subslab pressure difference

Note: This analysis only considers Chloroform.

The correlation between subslab pressure difference and $c_\mathrm{in}$ is the same for both the unheated and heated sides (same slope).
But since subslab pressure difference is larger in the heated side of the house, the correlations are shifted.

### Outdoor temperature

Note: This analysis only considers Chloroform.

$c_\mathrm{in}$ is reasonably well correlated with outdoor temperature for the heated side but completely flat for the unheated side.
When outside temperatures are low, $c_\mathrm{in}$ is higher for the heated, potentially due to the stack effect (burning) or simply due to the temperature difference itself - it is hard to say.

Outdoor temperature is well correlated with the subslab pressure difference for the heated side, but almost flat for the unheated.
Again, it is hard to say if this is due to the stack effect or due to the temperature difference in of itself.

It is interesting that these two correlations look so similar to each other, i.e. outdoor temp with $c_\mathrm{in}$ and subslab pressure difference.
