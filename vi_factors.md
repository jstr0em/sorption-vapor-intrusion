## Indoor preferential pathways

## Contaminant entry
### Air velocity

#### Permeability
#### Soil moisture

### Contaminant concentration
#### Source concentration
#### Soil moisture
#### Air velocity
Probably not so significant here (unless a subsurface preferential pathway is present).


## Air exchange rate
### Pressure difference

#### HVAC
#### Wind

### Wind
### Building properties



# Pressure difference
## Temperature difference?
Use Cantera to try to model the pressure difference due to temperature alone.
### Ambient temperature
### HVAC
Maybe use unheated side to remove this factor? Will probably still influence things.
At the very least should divide up based on AC/Heating on/off.
## Wind
User Kelly Pennell's work to understand this better.
## Barometric pressure

# Soil moisture
## Soil type
## Rain
## Snow
